# Predicting_Meteorite_Classification

## Introduction
The Meteoritical Society collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth. A dataset, provided by them, records of over 45,000 meteorites that have been collected or seen fallen and collected. For each 
meteorite, we know it's given name, classification, location, mass, and collection year. The distribution 
of meteoritic flux on on earth is largely uniform with a slight tendency towards the equator. However, for our purposes we can assume a fairly even distirbution of fallen meteorites over the globe. While the distribution of fallen meteorites are fairly even, the geographical and meteoric class distributions of collected meteorites are not. This study seeks to understand what variables control the collection of meteorites and predict what type of meteorites are more likely to be found in geographical regions.

## Collection Bias and Model Features

There is a large human collection bias that that seems to be associated with the ease of locating meteorites and the recognition of meteorites. There seems to be a large ammount of collections in the United States, deserts, and Antartica. This is due to specific collection methods and the geographical region being ideal for meteorite preservation. For example, every summer the Antartic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) team travel to Antartica to collect meteorites on the edge of glaciers. The features that we explore to explain the distribution of meteorite collections are population, distance from nearest population center, precipitation, topography, and distance from the ocean.
