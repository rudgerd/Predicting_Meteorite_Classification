# Predicting_Meteorite_Classification

## Introduction
The Meteoritical Society collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth. A dataset, provided by them, records of over 45,000 meteorites that have been collected or seen fallen and collected. For each 
meteorite, we know it's given name, classification, location, mass, and collection year. The distribution 
of meteoritic flux on on earth is largely uniform with a slight tendency towards the equator. We can assume a fairly even distirbution of fallen meteorites over the globe. However, 

## Collection Bias and Model Features

However, there is a large human collection bias that is associated with the ease of 
locating meteorites and the recognition of meteorite classes
