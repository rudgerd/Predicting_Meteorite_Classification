# Predicting_Meteorite_Classification

## Introduction
The Meteoritical Society collects data on meteorites that have fallen to Earth. We use a dataset that 
is a record of over 45,000 meteorites that have been collected or seen fallen and collected. For each 
meteorite, we know it's given name, classification, location, mass, and collection year. The distribution 
of meteoritic flux on on earth is largely uniform with a slight tendency towards the equator. However 
with then percentage of actual meteorites found, we can assume an even distirbution of fallen meteorites 
over the globe. However, there is a large human collection bias that is associated with the ease of 
locating meteorites and the recognition of meteorite classes.We will explore different features that 
might affect the finding of certain meteorite classes and try to predict what class of meteorites are 
found in different geographic locations.
